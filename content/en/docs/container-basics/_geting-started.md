## The command line tool

First it is time to become familiar with the command line utility. Using Docker consists of passing at least one command. `docker --help` shows the available options:

```bash
docker --help
```

```bash
Usage: docker COMMAND

A self-sufficient runtime for containers

Options:
      --config string      Location of client config files (default "/home/user/.docker")
  -D, --debug              Enable debug mode
      --help               Print usage
  -H, --host list          Daemon socket(s) to connect to
  -l, --log-level string   Set the logging level ("debug"|"info"|"warn"|"error"|"fatal") (default "info")
      --tls                Use TLS; implied by --tlsverify
      --tlscacert string   Trust certs signed only by this CA (default "/home/user/.docker/ca.pem")
      --tlscert string     Path to TLS certificate file (default "/home/user/.docker/cert.pem")
      --tlskey string      Path to TLS key file (default "/home/user/.docker/key.pem")
      --tlsverify          Use TLS and verify the remote
  -v, --version            Print version information and quit

## Hello world (with Docker images)

Docker containers are run from Docker images. By default, they pull these images from Docker Hub, a Docker registry managed by Docker Inc, the company behind the Docker project. Anybody can build and host their Docker images on Docker Hub, so for many applications and Linux distributions you'll find Docker images that are hosted on Docker Hub.

To check whether you can access and download images from Docker Hub, type:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

The output, which should include the following, indicates that Docker appears to be working correctly:

```bash
Hello from Docker.
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
...
```

## Your first container ðŸ˜ƒ

With this command, we just ran our first container on our computers. It ran a simple process that printed a message to standard out, the container itself is not very useful though.

## A closer look at the docker command

We've learned that the term "Docker" is used somewhat imprecisely. It's employed to refer to various components such as the CLI (Command Line Interface), the Docker Engine, the OCI image format, and the Container runtime. Let's take a closer look at what's happening when we use the command

```bash
docker run --rm -d --name sleep-container alpine sleep 900
```

We will come to the meaning of `-rm` and the other arguments later on. For now we need only to know that we started a container which sleeps for 900 seconds on our host.
First let us get the process id of the sleep process we just started:

```bash
PID=`docker inspect --format '{{.State.Pid}}' sleep-container`
```

Let us see the process running:

```bash
ps -u root -U root --forest -f | grep -B1 $PID
```

we see something like this

```bash
root       50221       1  0 17:00 ?        00:00:00 /usr/bin/containerd-shim-runc-v2 -namespace moby -id 724930591e3fbf44f9cacb60285c0420464c41f5a6366e2b4443c2b53e6cd251 -address /run/containerd/containerd.sock
root       53658   50221  0 17:00 ?        00:00:00  \_ sleep 900
```

indeed we see that we don't use docker as a container runtime but containerd at a higher level and runc at a lower level. The parent of each of these containerd-shim-runc-v2 processes is PID 1 on the system.

The shim becomes the parent process of the containerized application. It is responsible for tasks such as reaping zombie processes, handling container process I/O (standard input, output, error), and ensuring proper container cleanup upon exit. As a result containerd can upgrade and restart without affecting running containers.

Secondly we see that in the end a container is just a processes running on the host. If nothing else is configured it runs as root! Let us see the different isolation techniques beeing used:

```bash
sudo lsns -p $PID
```

which shows use the different (and newly created) namespaces beeing used for this container:

```bash
        NS TYPE   NPROCS   PID USER COMMAND
4026531834 time      463     1 root /sbin/init splash # time isolation
4026531837 user      423     1 root /sbin/init splash # uid gid isolation (root inside is not root outside)
4026534002 mnt         1 53658 root sleep 900 
4026534003 uts         1 53658 root sleep 900 # hostname isolation
4026534004 ipc         1 53658 root sleep 900
4026534005 pid         1 53658 root sleep 900
4026534006 net         1 53658 root sleep 900
4026534064 cgroup      1 53658 root sleep 900
```

By comparision a simple sleep command in the current shell would run in the same namespaces as the parent shell giving no isolation.
