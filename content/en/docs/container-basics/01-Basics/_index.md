## The command line tool

First it is time to become familiar with the command line utility. Using Docker consists of passing at least one command. `docker --help` shows the available options:

```bash
docker --help
```

```bash
Usage: docker COMMAND

A self-sufficient runtime for containers

Options:
      --config string      Location of client config files (default "/home/user/.docker")
  -D, --debug              Enable debug mode
      --help               Print usage
  -H, --host list          Daemon socket(s) to connect to
  -l, --log-level string   Set the logging level ("debug"|"info"|"warn"|"error"|"fatal") (default "info")
      --tls                Use TLS; implied by --tlsverify
      --tlscacert string   Trust certs signed only by this CA (default "/home/user/.docker/ca.pem")
      --tlscert string     Path to TLS certificate file (default "/home/user/.docker/cert.pem")
      --tlskey string      Path to TLS key file (default "/home/user/.docker/key.pem")
      --tlsverify          Use TLS and verify the remote
  -v, --version            Print version information and quit

```

To view the switches available to a specific command, type:

```bash
docker <command> --help
```

To view system-wide information about Docker, use:

```bash
docker info
```

## Hello world (with Docker images)

Docker containers are run from Docker images. By default, they pull these images from Docker Hub, a Docker registry managed by Docker Inc, the company behind the Docker project. Anybody can build and host their Docker images on Docker Hub, so for many applications and Linux distributions you'll find Docker images that are hosted on Docker Hub.

To check whether you can access and download images from Docker Hub, type:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

The output, which should include the following, indicates that Docker appears to be working correctly:

```bash
Hello from Docker.
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
...
```

## Your first container ðŸ˜ƒ

With this command, we just ran our first container on our computers. It ran a simple process that printed a message to standard out, the container itself is not very useful though.
