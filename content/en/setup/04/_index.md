## Try Docker without installation

The page <https://training.play-with-docker.com> offers additional tutorials which also come with an interactive shell. The disadvantage is that you have to create an account, but if you don't want to install Docker locally, this is a great way to do the exercises in this training using a browser-based Docker shell.

To do this lab with *Play with Docker*:

* Go to <https://labs.play-with-docker.com>
* Click on *Login*
* Enter your Docker login or register first
* Click *ADD NEW INSTANCE* and you are ready to do this training


## Next steps

When you're ready to go, head on over to the [labs](../../docs/) and begin with the training!
